INTERNSHIP REPORT
	I made an application to Basak Electric Ind.Trade.Co.Ltd. for intership.I started to work as a engineer assistant after receive an acceptance from company.The company was founded in 1995.The main office of company is in Esenyurt,Istanbul.The company focused on electricity infrastructure on buildings and constructions.
	When I started to work company that took the work which is about electricity infrastructure on buildings from big building enterprise which had project called ‘Tema Istanbul’ as a contractor company about electiricity in Kucukcekmece,Istanbul.If I give some informations about Tema Istanbul: This project began to be built on 1.5 million square meters and it planed out to build 3531 flat in this project. My company which is Basak Electric took charged of about 1000 flat’s electrical infrastructure with 20 employees, 1 general coordinator and some engineers and interns.
	The first day of work,when I entered company,they showed me my desk and then they introduced me with coordinator who is Cemalletin Kaymak and engineer who is İdris Cengiz.I was worked with İdris Cengiz as engineer assistant.He helped me so much for learning work stuffs and AutoCad.Then , I began to learn from engineers how i can read the projects and design with a software which is  AutoCAD.Two week later, i can read the projects and I can give information about them to other workers then they learned me how I can design project and they gave some part of project for drawing.The reading of project was pretty east but designing  project was quite hard.I was also did some paper works and run errand for company.To bring or send files and make a photocopy is part of may job.We spend our time learning things from engineers and make their errand works in office as a interns. Then coordinator of company told us we had to go building site for bring more information about the Tema Istanbul project with engineers so i could see how our projects applied in worksite pratically.When we went to building site engineers introduced us to leader of constructor who is Bilal Uyanik.His job is applying the projects on buildings and maneged to workers so he can read the projects like engineer also he know both side of project theoretical and practical.Enginners showed us how they control and check the each electricity of flat in buildings,they looked their projects and make comparison between applications of electricity and projects if they weren’t matched and misplaced some part of projects on buildings such as wire connection,junction box or etc. , engineers warned the leader of constructor for fixing them.The engineer who I was assistant of  told me that theoretical part of project which is designing on AutoCad is important but it couldnt work as same as practical part in the buildings site.If engineer want to good at job ,he/she need to be good in both skills which are controlling worksite and desinging and reading project.I was in office moslty in my work time and  they started to gave a lesson about AutoCAD to the interns for 1 hour almost everyday. I learned some basic implemantion for drawing the projects and designing electiricity structure of flats but  designing project wasnt be easy so i started to draw projects from looking other projects which were designed already.When I finished design of some parts of projects , the engineers checked my designed project and they told me my mistakes and gave information how I fixing them because making mistake on design of project cause more damage to company then making application on worksite.It tooks a long time to fix and also its cost is getting higher.After a while,the office works were getting less and we went to worksite more.The engineers empose us to observing the building site and finding mistakes are maintanance of  the job for getting  process.The enginner must be well organised and make a plan of applicaiton of project if something get late or early,it cause damage to profit so good timing and risk managment are maden profit to company.For example engineers make a  decision to span wire on wrong way,their company get troubled with construction company because for spaning wire workers drill walls and if it is wrong they have to drill new holes and construction company want compensation from electricity company also new goods need to be spaning wires, both of situation are damage for our company.Basak Electric faced with some situations like this in Tema Istanbul project.In last two weeks, I was busy controlling projects and making calculations because engineers gave us some flats’s project to compare with projects which is sending by worksite. They wanted us to finding mistakes or missing part not so i went to check  nearly 45-50 flats with other interns. When we were checking the projects, always need to be good at reading and comparing project with application if we found something we told engineers and also leader of construction. Finally,I learned a lot of stuffs about electiricity infrastructure.I improved myself about designing projects in AutoCad, learning and understanding  atmosphere of worksite and having idea about electiricty tools. To sum up, Basak Elecric have a nice atmosphere for doing intership and employees are friendly and helpful.Espically, Idris Cengiz who is responsible engineer for me was very helpful to improve my self about being electrical engineer, he learned me both of sides being engineering as  morality and techinally.I am glad to do my intership in Basak Electric and thankful for all workers.
